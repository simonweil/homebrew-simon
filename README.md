These formulae are my own duplicates or self made for my own uses.
Use on your own risk.

How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap simonweil/simon` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from mxcl/master or another tap, you can `brew install simonweil/simon/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.github.com/simonweil/homebrew-simon/master/<formula>.rb
```
